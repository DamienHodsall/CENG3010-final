# CENG3010-final

# TODO

- [ ] rewrite keypad2.vhd so it sends it all in one go instead of multiple times without really finishing
- [ ] fix the issue with requiring the first input twice
- [ ] fix the double reset problem (these two seem like they might be connected)
- [ ] fix the issue where you can enter without a password after clearing a successful opening
- [ ] slap some stickers on the keypad (avoids rewriting keypad2)
